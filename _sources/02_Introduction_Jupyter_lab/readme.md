# Introduction to Jupyter Lab and napari
In this chapter we will introduce [Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org) an interactive environment for developing Python code in notebooks. 
The slides are available [online](https://github.com/BiAPoL/DIGS-BB_LM_Course_Bio-Image_Analysis_2022/blob/main/docs/LM_DIGS-BB_2022_Day4_Extra_Bio-Image_Analysis.pdf). 
Afterwards, you will immediately write our own notebooks and learn how to use them properly avoiding common pitfalls.
You will also learn how to call napari from a jupyter notebook and how they can exchange information mutually, like changing napari contrast from the notebook or updating the colormap in napari and getting that update in the notebook.
